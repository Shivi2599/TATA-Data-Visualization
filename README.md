# Tata Group Data Visualization - Virtual Internship

Welcome to my Tata Data Visualization project, which was completed as part of the **Tata Group Virtual Internship** on Forage.  This **Data Visualization Virtual Internship** offered by Tata through Forage provides hands-on experience in leveraging data to create meaningful visual insights. By participating in this program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world data challenges faced by Tata Group’s businesses and enhance my skills in **data visualization** using **Power BI**.

The internship tasks were designed to simulate real-world business scenarios, requiring the use of data visualization techniques to solve complex problems and offer insights to business stakeholders.

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.
